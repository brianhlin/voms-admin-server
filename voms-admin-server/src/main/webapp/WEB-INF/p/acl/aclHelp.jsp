    <h1>The VOMS Admin Authorization framework</h1>
      <p>
    In VOMS-Admin, each operation that access the VOMS database is authorized via the VOMS-Admin Authorization framework.
    <br /> 
    For instance, only authorized admins have the rights to add users or create groups for a specific VO. 
    More specifically, Access Control Lists (ACLs) are linked to VOMS contexts to enforce authorization decisions on such contexts. 
    In this framework, a Context is either a VOMS group, or a VOMS role within a group.<br/> 
    Each Context as an ACL, which is a set of ACL  entries, i.e., (VOMS Administrator, VOMSPermission) couples.
  </p>
  
  
  <p>
    A <span style="font-weight: bold">VOMS Administrator</span> may be:
    
  </p>
  <ul>
      <li>A VO administrator registered in the VO VOMS database;</li>
      <li>A VO user;</li>
      <li>A VOMS FQAN that describe, for instance, all the members of a specific VOMS group or all the members
        that have a specific role in a given group;
      </li>
      <li>Any authenticated user, i.e. any user that authenticates at the service presenting a valid certificate signed
      by a trusted CA.</li>
  </ul>
