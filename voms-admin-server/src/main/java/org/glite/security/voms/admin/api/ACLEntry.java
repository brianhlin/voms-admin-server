/**
 * Represents access control list entries within the VOMS database.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Access control lists (ACLs) provide authorization information within the VOMS
 * database. They consists of a list of principal-operation-allow/deny triplets
 * called ACL entries. An entry allows or denies an operation to a client
 * principal based on its third element. A client is allowed to perform an
 * operation if she has no matching deny entry but at least one allow entry in
 * the relevant ACL.
 * 
 * <p>
 * The principal of an ACL entry may be a VO group or role in this or in another
 * VO, in which case that entry matches a set of clients instead of a single
 * individual client.
 * 
 * <p>
 * The following operations are defined: <code>CREATE</code>,
 * <code>DELETE</code>, <code>ADD</code>, <code>REMOVE</code>,
 * <code>SET_ACL</code>, <code>GET_ACL</code>, <code>SET_DEFAULT_ACL</code>,
 * <code>GET_DEFAULT_ACL</code>, <code>LIST</code>, plus a special wildcard
 * operation <code>ALL</code>, which is a shorthand for all operations.
 * 
 * @author <a href="mailto:Akos.Frohner@cern.ch">Akos Frohner</a>
 * @deprecated Starting from VOMS Admin 2, this interface for ACL management is
 *             deprecated an no longer understood. Use the ACL management
 *             interface defined in {@link VOMSACL}.
